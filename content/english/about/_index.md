Librezo is a collective of professionals who pool their know-how to:

* Promote computer solutions in free licenses as alternatives to proprietary solutions (eg: GAFAM).
* Encourage the installation of self-hosted solutions guaranteeing the confidentiality and security of our personal data.
* Create a network of trust throughout the territory.
* Accompany customers and partners towards true digital autonomy. It's at
  say using exclusively free software.
* Develop a viable economic model based on free software, by implementing services.

Librezo's mission is part of a technical desire to decentralize computer servers to protect itself from general surveillance and censorship. This decentralization also responds to the necessary reduction of the digital energy footprint.

Belonging to the Librezo network means adhering to common values:
* Freedom as symmetrical non-nuisance.
* Horizontality favored in governance.
* Sharing and transmission of knowledge.
* Autonomy and mutual aid.
* Contribution to the development of the free software ecosystem.
* Closeness and individual trust.

The Librezo adventure is an experiment in corporate democracy.
